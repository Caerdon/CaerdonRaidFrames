# Caerdon Raid Frames

This builds on top of the default Blizzard UI raid frames and adds functionality where possible.  Currently, this add-on is limited to changing the color any raid frame that has a debuff your class is able to dispel.  It will change the color differently depending on whether it's a poison, curse, disease, or magic debuff.  It's also only as smart as the Blizzard raid frame is currently.  So it doesn't work great for warlock pet dispels, for instance.

I'm working hard to ensure any functionality continues to work whether the party changes, you get disconnected in combat, etc.  They have things pretty locked down, so I'm not sure how much I can do, but I'll keep pushing at it as I have ideas.
